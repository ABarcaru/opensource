Note to External Contributors
-----------------------------

Hello, External Person!

We at Medium are eager to work with you. For small changes &mdash;
little bugfixes, correcting typos, and the like &mdash; please just
submit pull requests to any of our projects. For larger changes,
though, we have to ask you to jump through a little hoop.

In particular, in order for us to accept any major patches from you,
you will have to electronically sign a statement that indicates two
things:

* You are willingly licensing your contributions under the terms of
  the open source license of the project that you're contributing to.

* You are legally able to license your contributions as stated.

The reason we do this is to ensure, to the extent possible, that we
don't "taint" the projects we manage with contributions that turn out
to be improper. This protects everyone who wants to use the projects,
including *you*! If you want a longer explanation, then you can check
out the [CLA Rationale
page](https://github.com/Medium/opensource/blob/master/cla-rationale.md).

Once you sign the Contributor License Agreement (the "CLA"),
we will then be able to merge your contributions with a clear
conscience and with only the friction that results from the usual
technical back-and-forth of a vibrant open source project.

To get started with this process, visit the
[Sign the CLA](https://github.com/Medium/opensource/blob/master/sign-cla.md)
page.

For reference, the standard open source license used by A Medium
Corporation is the
[MIT License](https://github.com/Medium/opensource/blob/master/mit-license.md)
with a small clarifying preamble. Some projects created before March 6, 2014 use
the Apache 2.0 License (https://github.com/Medium/opensource/blob/master/apache-license-2.0.md)

If you have any questions about any of this, please raise them by
filing a bug on this project, since there's a good chance that if you
have a question then someone else has the same question too. If it is
really and truly a private matter, then you can mail Medium's
official Open Sourceror privately, at
[open-source@medium.com](mailto:open-source@medium.com).

Thanks, and happy hacking!

Cheers,

Your friends at A Medium Corporation
